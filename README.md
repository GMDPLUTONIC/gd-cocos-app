# gd-cocos-app

Standalone executable that links to gd's libcocos2d.dll, with a window and sample scene.

Based off the [cocos2d-x 2.2.3 HelloCpp sample](https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/tree/cocos2d-x-2.2.3/samples/Cpp/HelloCpp/Classes)

The executable **must** be executed within the gd folder, as it needs the dlls and some gd [resources](https://github.com/matcool/gd-cocos-app/blob/main/src/AppDelegate.cpp#L21)
